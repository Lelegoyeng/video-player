- <b>Intuitive Navigation</b>: The player has been designed with TV experiences in mind. Cursor and arrow-key navigation make the user experience smooth and intuitive across big-screen platforms.
- <b>YouTube Integration</b>: One of its unique strengths is its ability to play YouTube and Vimeo videos directly, saving the cost and hassle of additional media encoding.
- <b>DRM Considerations</b>: While it supports HLS AES Encryption, itâ€™s built with flexibility in mind, allowing future DRM integration with hls.js and dash.js.
